Often, however, nodes start with a small team and limited resources.  In order to be most effective, nodes should consider which roles are essential for them to carry out, and which can be delegated to other stakeholders in the network they will be establishing.  A good way to formalize these collaborations and shared roles is to establish *governance structures*, such as a board or steering committee, as well as advisory committees, such as a scientific advisory committee."
