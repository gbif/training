msgid "As we have seen throughout this course, GBIF provides value across a range of scientific and policy-relevant thematic areas, and the benefits of participating in GBIF are wide ranging, from technology and infrastructure-related benefits, to capacity development, to supporting research, and to helping to fulfil national commitments under related multilateral environmental agreements.  The https://docs.gbif.org/gbif-communications-strategy/1.0/en/[GBIF communication strategy^] introduces the importance of targeting your messages to align with the needs and interests of your specific audience."

msgid "[quote, GBIF Communication Strategy] GBIF’s future depends in part on remaining useful and relevant to a relatively small number of decision makers in key policymaking and funding positions.  If these funders and executives are unconvinced of GBIF’s utility value, it will not survive even if all other aspects of its communication strategy are successful.  The communication needs of this group are characterized by *brevity and clarity; messages must be conveyed strategically, succinctly and persuasively, and often delivered opportunistically and at short notice*. Decision makers are the primary consumers of the ‘elevator pitch’—the 30-second explanation of GBIF’s value that can influence participation or withdrawal of support from governments and agencies."
