"To write effective activities and deliverables, you may want to take "
"inspiration with the SMART framework. SMART is the acronym for Specific, "
"Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This framework helps you "
"to define what you want to achieve, how you'll measure progress, ensure it's "
"realistic, aligns with overall objective, and when it will be complete. And "
"as a part of being specific, this is also a good opportunity to define who "
"(perhaps a specific role or team) will be responsible for completing the "
"activities and deliverables. Use what makes sense for your project in your "
"activity and deliverable descriptions."
