"occurrence\n"
"Most of the time, specimens from collection databases are shared as occurrence data. Each occurrence (specimen or group of specimens) has its own unique identifier (sometimes derived from its catalogue number in the source collection) and the Darwin Core fields used to share them within GBIF describe each specimen: scientific name, the date it was collected on the field, who collected and/or identified it, where, etc. Each collection can have more than one specimen from a same species, as long as each specimen is identified by a unique ID.

"sampling event\n"
"Insect traps (as well as other traps such as pitfall traps, malaise traps…) are typically used in monitoring programmes to check the presence (or absence) of some species and/or assess their specific abundance.  Using the “eventID” field to identify each trap allows the users to get all of the specimens collected within each trap. The same logic applies to other field protocols such as transects, plots, remote cameras, etc.: by using the Event Core instead of the Occurrence core, you’ll be able to share much more information about the context of the data collection, and allow users to better understand (and even replicate) your work."
