"Since GBIF’s founding in 2001, the participating countries and organizations "
"have been testing and developing models for coordinating the mobilization, "
"management and reuse of biodiversity data at the national level or within an "
"organization’s scope.  The formation of Participant ‘nodes’ has been central "
"to these efforts.  Designated by each Participant, these teams coordinate "
"the needs and interests of the many stakeholders involved.  In this video "
"(07:53), we look at the variety of node models in the GBIF network to "
"present generalized concepts relating to Participant nodes and the roles "
"that they play in the GBIF community.  If you are unable to watch the "
