"As we have seen throughout this course, GBIF provides value across a range "
"of scientific and policy-relevant thematic areas, and the benefits of "
"participating in GBIF are wide ranging, from technology and infrastructure-"
"related benefits, to capacity development, to supporting research, and to "
"helping to fulfil national commitments under related multilateral "
"environmental agreements.  The https://docs.gbif.org/gbif-communications-"
"strategy/1.0/en/[GBIF communication strategy^] introduces the importance of "
"targeting your messages to align with the needs and interests of your "
"specific audience."

"Remember that GBIF Participant countries may have different priorities and "
"interests depending on which Ministry signs the Memorandum of Understanding: "
"for example, Ministries of Environment often oversee the responsibilities "
"under the Convention on Biological Diversity, while Ministries of Science "

"[quote, GBIF Communication Strategy] GBIF’s future depends in part on "
"remaining useful and relevant to a relatively small number of decision "
"makers in key policymaking and funding positions.  If these funders and "
"executives are unconvinced of GBIF’s utility value, it will not survive even "
"if all other aspects of its communication strategy are successful.  The "
"communication needs of this group are characterized by *brevity and clarity; "
"messages must be conveyed strategically, succinctly and persuasively, and "
"often delivered opportunistically and at short notice*. Decision makers are "
"the primary consumers of the ‘elevator pitch’—the 30-second explanation of "
"GBIF’s value that can influence participation or withdrawal of support from "
"governments and agencies."
