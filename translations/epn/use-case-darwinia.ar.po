They see benefits of participating in the GBIF network and would like to build a case for their country to join and establish a national node."

msgid "The *Darwinia natural history museum*, the largest biological collection based in the nation of Darwinia, responded to a call for proposals for biodiversity data mobilization projects issued by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), in partnership with the smaller herbarium collection at the *Darwinia National University*.  Both project partners had limited capacity in data management prior to the project, but succeeded in getting a grant to begin digitizing their collections.  After receiving training, the museum staff have now installed software for managing their collections and the museum published the first datasets to GBIF.  The herbarium is still using spreadsheets to manage their data, but has advanced with the digitization and has also published data to GBIF, after gaining permission to use the IPT hosted at the Darwinia natural history museum."

The national university has recently started a Master’s programme for biodiversity and conservation studies within the biology faculty and is keen to integrate teaching on biodiversity informatics within the course.  Both institutions receive national funding through the *Ministry for Research, Science and Higher Education*."

The CBD focal point is planning to apply for a *Global Environment Facility (GEF)* grant to establish a national biodiversity monitoring system that would address the gaps in biodiversity information identified in the national report through the establishment of a database.  The Ministry of Environment and the Ministry for Research, Science and Higher Education do not have any policies regarding the sharing of biodiversity data on the national level, although the government has been promoting transparency and open data."

Darwinia has a very active tourism industry and is well known for its national parks and nature, although a growing number of the charismatic fauna and flora are threatened due to habitat loss (primarily due to expanding mining and logging industries) and the impacts of invasive alien species.  Representatives of the *Ministry for Tourism* were also invited to the meeting, and there are several private reserves that focus on eco-tourism that are receiving a growing number of tourists annually."
