"In addition to institution and collection entries, GRSciColl records are "

"allows to display some aggregated metrics on GRSciColl pages regardless of "
"the way that the data were published on GBIF.org. One collection can be "
"linked to occurrence records coming from different GBIF datasets and one "
"dataset can have records linked to several collection entries. Occurrences "
"are linked to institution and collection entries based on the collection and "
"institution codes and identifiers used. The GRSciColl API also supports the "
"creation of explicit mapping (find out more in the other modules)."

"GRSciColl also supports the upload of collection information as structured "
"tables called **collection descriptors**. Collection descriptors can contain "
"relevant details about collections and sub-collections as well as "
"quantitative data which cannot be shared on collection pages (for example, "
"the number of fossil specimens collected in a particular region). Some "
"collection descriptors are used for indexing collections. This means that "
"they improve collection discoverability. For example, a collection "
"associated with a moss species name will be found by users looking for "
"“Bryophyta” in the scientific name field of the collection search. "
"Collection descriptors are particularly relevant for collections that aren’t "
"fully digitized and/or where the specimen records aren’t available on GBIF."

"descriptor groups (tables)."

"Finally, any GRSciColl collection or institution entry can be associated "
"with **machine tags** (machineTag). Machine tags are meant to be machine "
"readable information to facilitate the programmatic processing of GRSciColl "
"data (they are not meant to be displayed). For example, they are used by "
"Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio) to show some of GRSciColl data "
"on their collection portal: https://portal.idigbio.org/portal/collections."
