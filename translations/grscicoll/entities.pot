"linked to occurrence records coming from different GBIF datasets and one "
"dataset can have records linked to several collection entries. Occurrences "
"are linked to institution and collection entries based on the collection and "
"institution codes and identifiers used. The GRSciColl API also supports the "

"GRSciColl also supports the upload of collection information as structured "

"relevant details about collections and sub-collections as well as "
"quantitative data which cannot be shared on collection pages (for example, "
"the number of fossil specimens collected in a particular region). Some "
"collection descriptors are used for indexing collections. This means that "
"they improve collection discoverability. For example, a collection "
"associated with a moss species name will be found by users looking for "
"“Bryophyta” in the scientific name field of the collection search. "
"Collection descriptors are particularly relevant for collections that aren’t "
"fully digitized and/or where the specimen records aren’t available on GBIF."

"descriptor groups (tables)."

"Finally, any GRSciColl collection or institution entry can be associated "

"readable information to facilitate the programmatic processing of GRSciColl "
"data (they are not meant to be displayed). For example, they are used by "
"Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio) to show some of GRSciColl data "
