"GRSciColl collection descriptors are meant to share structured information "
"about collections. They can contain relevant details about collections and "
"sub-collections as well as quantitative data which cannot be shared on "
"collection pages (for example, the number of type specimens for a particular "
"taxon). Some collection descriptors are used for indexing collections. This "
"means that they improve collection discoverability. For example, a "
"collection entry associated with dragonfly species names will be found by "
"users looking for “Odonata” in the scientific name field of the collection "
"search."
