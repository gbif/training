If you wish to create metrics for a subset of specimen related records published on GBIF, consider selecting the occurrences based on their associated data (for example, their scientific names). If you are publishing occurrences shared on GBIF, consider using Darwin Core terms like https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/#dwc:datasetID[datasetID^] for occurrences to facilitate their selection."
