"Collections. All the functions available in the GRSciColl website and "
"editing interface are also available in the API, including adding, editing "

"In order to use the GRSciColl API, you will need to use a client in the "

"Garden (https://scientific-collections.gbif.org/institution/ab83e5ab-"
"f4f7-4c9b-a1d5-eb779dfb9377), you would have to use the UUID from its URL: "
"`ab83e5ab-f4f7-4c9b-a1d5-eb779dfb9377`. This will allow you to tie the "
