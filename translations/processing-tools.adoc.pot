"While GBIF filters will allow you to select and download data that only "
"fulfils specific criteria, it is highly recommended that you perform "
"additional data processing.  Your choice for a data processing tool should "
"be based on personal access, familiarity and utility of that tool(s)."

"It is always important to include a data visualisation step in your data "
"processing so that you can identify anomalous data points that may have been "
"missed during the processing stage. This can be done within R, however, with "
"OpenRefine or spreadsheet editing sofware you may have to use GIS software "
"or even tools such as Google Earth for data visualisation."
