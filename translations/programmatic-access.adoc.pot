"The https://api.gbif.org/[GBIF API^] was developed to provide a programmatic "
"way to query and publish data on GBIF.org. The API can be used to make "
"advanced queries that are not supported by the website. It can also be used "
"to include the results of GBIF queries in scripts, workflows or analyses, "
"which can then be repeated reliably and automatically. It can even allow "
"GBIF data to be embedded into other websites. It can be accessed using any "
"programming language, from a command-line terminal interface, or in some "
"cases using a web browser."
