msgid "Filtering the data allows you as a user to obtain the data that is most fit for purpose.  All searches have a set of filters that can be used for finding the data you need, and the occurrence search has a set of additional \"Advanced\" search filters with more criteria or options available.  While filters may allow you to filter out data that may not be relevant, or be of lower quality for your purposes, additional filtering may be required, either manually or programmaticially, to deal with additional data quality issues that arise.  Below are some common data filters that you as a user might consider to make the data more fit for use."

msgid "Country centroids are where the observation is pinned to the centre of the country instead of where the taxon was observed or recorded.  Country centroids are usually records that have been retrospectively given a lat-lon value based on a textual description of where the original record was located.  Geocoding software uses gazetteers, geographical dictionaries or directories used in conjunction with a map or atlas, to attribute coordinates to place names.  So, if the record simply says “Brazil”, some publishers will use the center of Brazil as the coordinate of the record.  Similarly if the record simply says “Texas” or “Paris” the record will go in the center of those regions.  This is almost exclusively a feature of museum data (PRESERVED_SPECIMEN), but it can also happen with other types of records as well."

There are two fields in Darwin Core - coordinate precision and coordinateUncertaintyInMeters - that you receive with a SIMPLE CSV download. You can use these fields to filter by “uncertainty”.  However, these fields are not used very often by publishers who feel that their records are fairly certain (from a GPS) and we would recommend not filtering out missing values."

In the case of the value 301, the uncertainty is often much-much greater than 301 and actually represents a country centroid."
