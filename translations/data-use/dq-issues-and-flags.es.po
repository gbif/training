msgid "The GBIF network publishes datasets, integrating them into a common access system.  Here, users can retrieve data through common search and download services.  During the indexation process over the raw data, GBIF adds issues and flags to records with common data quality problems.  These may contain useful information for you as a user to create fit-for-purpose datasets."

It is possible to filter all records you are not interested in with issues by selecting the particular issue and hitting the reverse button.  However, reversing will still only give you all other flagged occurrences and not issue-free records.  This is something that GBIF is working to improve."
