msgid "Precision (or Resolution) can be divided into two main types.  Statistical precision is the closeness with which repeated observations conform to themselves.  They have nothing to do with their relationship to the true value, and may have high precision, but low accuracy.  Numerical precision is the number of significant digits that an observation is recorded in and has become far more obvious with the advent of computers.  For example a database may output a decimal latitude/longitude record to 10 decimal places – i.e. ca .01 mm when in reality the record has a resolution no greater than 10-100 m (3-4 decimal places).  This often leads to a false impression of both the resolution and the accuracy."

As independently stated by Chrisman (1991) and Strong et al. (1997), data quality is related to use and cannot be assessed independently of the user.  In a database, the data have no actual quality or value (Dalcin 2004); they only have potential value that is realized only when someone uses the data to do something useful.  Information quality relates to its ability to satisfy its customers and to meet customers’ needs (English 1999)."

Uncertainty is a property of the observer’s understanding of the data, and is more about the observer than the data per se.  There is always uncertainty in data; the difficulty is in recording, understanding and visualizing that uncertainty so that others can also understand it.  Uncertainty is a key term in understanding risk and risk assessment."

Random error tends to refer to deviation from the true state in a random manner.  Systematic error or bias arises from a uniform shift in values and is sometimes described as having ‘relative accuracy’ in the cartographic world (Chrisman 1991).  In determining ‘fitness for use’ systematic error may be acceptable for some applications, and unfit for others."

The process may include format checks, completeness checks, reasonableness checks, limit checks, review of the data to identify outliers (geographic, statistical, temporal or environmental) or other errors, and assessment of data by subject area experts (e.g. taxonomic specialists).  These processes usually result in flagging, documenting and subsequent checking of suspect records.  Validation checks may also involve checking for compliance against applicable standards, rules, and conventions.  A key stage in data validation and cleaning is to identify the root causes of the errors detected and to focus on preventing those errors from re-occurring (Redman 2001)."

The term is synonymous with “data cleansing”, although some use data cleansing to encompass both data validation and data cleaning.  It is important in the data cleaning process that data is not inadvertently lost, and changes to existing information be carried out very carefully.  It is often better to retain both the old (original data) and the new (corrected data) side by side in the database so that if mistakes are made in the cleaning process, the original information can be recovered."
