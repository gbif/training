"The GBIF network publishes datasets, integrating them into a common access "
"system.  Here, users can retrieve data through common search and download "
"services.  During the indexation process over the raw data, GBIF adds issues "
"and flags to records with common data quality problems.  These may contain "
"useful information for you as a user to create fit-for-purpose datasets."

"Excluding all records with a particular issue is not currently possible with "

"flagged occurrences and not issue-free records.  This is something that GBIF "
"is working to improve."
