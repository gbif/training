msgid "It is always important to include a data visualisation step in your data processing so that you can identify anomalous data points that may have been missed during the processing stage. This can be done within R, however, with OpenRefine or spreadsheet editing sofware you may have to use GIS software or even tools such as Google Earth for data visualisation."
