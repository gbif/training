= Principles of GBIF-mediated data

[NOTE.activity]
====
In this section, you will learn about the principles that GBIF follows with regards to data and how data in the GBIF portal are FAIR.

NOTE: This is a review of information found in the Introduction to GBIF course, if you need a refresher.

== Digital object identifiers

A Digital Object Identifier, or DOI, is a http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=43506[standard^], permanent identifier that provides an actionable, interoperable, persistent link to any entity. 
The concept is that DOI differs from commonly used references like URL web links because it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity, not simply the place where the object is currently located.

In the context of GBIF.org, DOIs serve as stable identifiers for four different types of things: 

. datasets from the GBIF network
. data downloads from GBIF.org
. research articles and reports published by scientific journals, agencies and NGOs
. materials deposited in a general-use repository

GBIF assigns DOIs to all datasets and occurrence downloads. 
When data is used, following DOI https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines[citation practice^] ensures an easy and consistent way of crediting dataset holders while also allowing for reproducibility. 
The DOIs will always resolve to datasets or download pages, even if the underlying data is no longer available.

GBIF started issuing DOIs on 3 February 2015. 
Downloads requested before this date do not have DOIs, however, if you wish to cite older downloads, you can contact helpdesk@gbif.org and we will assign DOIs as appropriate.

== Standards

The data available through GBIF.org and its associated services is the result of the GBIF network of Participants and publishers applying shared rules and conventions to describe, record and structure thousands of different datasets drawn from hundreds of institutions around the world. Common standards are the main enabler for bringing together the hundreds of millions of primary biodiversity records in the GBIF index.

Within the biodiversity domain, the group most often responsible for developing and maintaining data standards is http://www.tdwg.org/[Biodiversity Information Standards^]. This nonprofit scientific and educational association focuses on the development of standards for the exchange of biological and biodiversity data. Members of the biodiversity community generally refer to this group as TDWG (pronounced tad-wig)—a vestigial reminder of its earlier manifestation as the Taxonomic Databases Working Group.

Commonly used standards include:

* Darwin Core: The https://dwc.tdwg.org/[Darwin Core Standard^] (DwC) offers a stable, straightforward and flexible framework for compiling biodiversity data from varied and variable sources. 
The majority of the datasets shared through GBIF.org are published using the Darwin Core Archive format (DwC-A).
* Ecological Metadata Language (EML): https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/[Ecological Metadata Language^] is a metadata standard that records information about ecological datasets in a series of modular and extensible XML document types. 
All of the descriptions of datasets in GBIF.org rely on ‘metadata’—that is, the information about data—using the open-source EML standard, which is administered and maintained by https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/[The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity^].
Each Darwin Core Archive includes as one of its components an EML file (written in XML format).
* BioCASe/ABCD: The http://www.biocase.org/[Biological Collection Access Service^], commonly referred to as BioCASe, is an international network linking biological collections data from natural history museums, botanical/zoological gardens and research institutions. The http://www.biocase.org/products/protocols[BioCASe protocol^] relies on the http://www.tdwg.org/standards/115[Access to Biological Collections Data^] (ABCD) data exchange standard, which TDWG also administers.

== Open data

In keeping with a 2014 https://www.gbif.org/news/82363/new-approaches-to-data-licensing-and-endorsement[decision by the GBIF governing board^], data publishers must assign one of the three Creative Commons options to any occurrence dataset. The Governing Board recognized the need for much greater clarity both for data publishers and users on how data may be used when shared via GBIF.org. https://creativecommons.org/[Creative Commons] is a nonprofit organization that helps overcome legal obstacles to the sharing of knowledge and creativity to address the world’s pressing challenges.

* http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0[CC0^] - no conditions for use
* https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/[CC-BY^] - use with attribution
* http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/[CC-BY-NC^] - non-commercial use with attribution 

IMPORTANT: Note that the CC-BY-NC licence has a significant effect on the reusability of data. GBIF encourages data publishers to choose the most open option they can wherever possible. It is important to note that images are not subject to the same licence that is applied to the dataset and may have more restricted terms of use. Lastly, attribution/citation is a community norm, so even if the publishers have waived conditions for use, attribution is expected.

== FAIR data

Many articles from 2011-2016 documented a crisis in scientific reproducibility (see below). 
In 2016, the https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618[FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship^] were published in https://www.nature.com/sdata/[Scientific Data^]. 
The principles were designed to improve the Findability, Accessibility, the Interoperability and the Reusability of datasets and address "an urgent need to improve the infrastructure supporting the reuse of scholarly data." 
Implementation of these principles began in 2018.

*Data found on GBIF.org are FAIR.*

****
*FINDABLE*

GBIF has https://www.gbif.org/data-quality-requirements[requirements] for metadata and datasets. All datasets are identified by https://www.gbif.org/faq?question=how-and-when-does-gbif-assign-digital-object-identifiers-dois[Digital Object Identifiers^] (DOIs).
****

****
*ACCESSIBLE*

The https://www.gbif.org/developer/summary[GBIF Portal API^] provides a machine-readable interface (REST + JSON) and uses the https://www.gbif.org/ipt[Integrated Publishing Toolkit^] (IPT) as trusted data repository.
****

****
*INTEROPERABLE*

GBIF recommends using the https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/[Ecological Metadata Language^] (EML) for datasets and https://dwc.tdwg.org/[Darwin Core^] for occurrence data.
****

****
*REUSABLE*

GBIF require creative common data licenses (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0[CC0^], https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0[CC BY^], or https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0[CC BY-NC^]). Provenance available from the GBIF portal.
