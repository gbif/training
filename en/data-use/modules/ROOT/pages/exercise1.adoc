== Scenario

Imagine you are about to assess a species, perhaps choose a species that you are familiar with.  Determine which of the listed Darwin Core terms might be more relevant than others in assessing the extinction risk of a species and what might be some of the data quality issues associated with those terms. Remember that information for a red list assessment can be observed, estimated, inferred, projected and suspected.

TIP: You find other relevant terms to add to your list beyond the ones provided on the exercise sheet.
