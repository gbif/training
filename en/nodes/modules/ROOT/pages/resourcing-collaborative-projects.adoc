= Resourcing and collaborative projects

== Context

[NOTE.description]
====
There is huge variety in the ways that nodes' resource their activities. Most nodes combine sources of funding and institutional support to deliver their work programmes. 
Not only newly established nodes need to consider how to make the case for funding their activities, and there is much we can learn from sharing experiences on this topic. Many nodes have success stories to share in designing and implementing funded projects based on collaborative actions with other nodes in the network. These projects are essential in strengthening the nodes community. In this module, nodes will share their experiences, tips and recommendations for resourcing their activities, as well as working in groups to consider how to design three typical collaborative project types: mentoring actions, regional events and data mobilization projects. 

These materials were developed as part of the 2019 Global Nodes training in Leiden, Netherlands.

=== Project assessment exercise

[NOTE.activity]
====
For this activity, we will split into groups focused on one of three typical project types: mentoring projects, data mobilization projects and regional events. Each group will firstly take on the role of assessing fictitious concept notes and then work on developing a full proposal.
