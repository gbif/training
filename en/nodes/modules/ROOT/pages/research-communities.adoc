= Engaging research communities for data mobilization and use

== Context

[NOTE.description]
====
Nodes play an essential role in building engagement with researchers within their countries and networks, promoting open science principles (in line with the https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation[UNESCO open science recommendation^]) and building communities of data publishers and users. Research communities can help to identify data gaps, data needs, and challenges in the use of the available data that can help nodes to prioritize activities. Several nodes have succeeded in embedding GBIF within academic training programmes (see https://www.gbif.org/article/aA0MjVddRiRFOX2SEs7mT/[guiding example from Benin^]), developing capacity and encouraging new generations of researchers to follow open science practices. GBIF’s focus on thematic communities (including soil, freshwater and disease vector thematic communities in 2023), will lead to growing interest in data publishing and data use from researchers that will seek to connect with nodes for support. (See https://docs.gbif.org/nodes-implementation-2023/en/#1-engage-research-communities-for-data-mobilization-and-use[Nodes Strategy #1] for more detail.

These materials were developed as part of the 2023 Global Nodes training in Canberra, Australia.

=== Discussion

[NOTE.speak]
During this section you will contribute to a discussion on engaging research communities. 

&nbsp;

=== Identifying use of data

[NOTE.activity]
For this activity, you will watch a demonstration and then have the opportunity examine the use of science in your country.

&nbsp;

. Scroll and select the https://www.gbif.org/resource/search?contentType=literature&literatureType=journal&relevance=GBIF_USED&peerReview=true[Peer-reviewed papers using Data^] section on the GBIF.org homepage.
. Using the filters on the left, select a *Topic*.
. Using the filters on the left, select your country for the *Country or area of researcher*. Note the number of peer-reviewed papers.
. *Clear your filter* for Country or area of researcher.
. Using the filters on the left, select your country for *Country or area of coverage*. Note the number of peer-reviewed papers.
. *Select one of the papers*. Examine the information provided. Do you know any of the researchers?
. Using the search in the menu bar (magnifying glass icon), *search for your country*.
. Select your country from the result and review the *Activity report*. How might you use this information in engaging with researchers in your community?
