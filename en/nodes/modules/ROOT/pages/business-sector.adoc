= Promoting open biodiversity data approaches within the business sector

== Context

[NOTE.description]
====
In recent years, several nodes have scaled up engagement with the private sector resulting in increased data mobilization, partnerships, and communication materials to support further engagement (see the resources developed and available for reuse through the https://www.gbif.org/project/2Zik1tfJoh3C92ZslvhDIr/[CESP OpenPSD project^] and the https://www.gbif.org/business[GBIF business sector page^]). (See https://docs.gbif.org/nodes-implementation-2023/en/#3-promote-open-biodiversity-data-approaches-within-the-business-and-finance-sectors[Nodes Strategy #3^] for more detail.)

These materials were developed as part of the 2023 Global Nodes training in Canberra, Australia.
