= Strengthening support services for collections communities

== Context

[NOTE.description]
====
Nodes have been actively contributing to updating and enriching the content of the https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll[Global Registry of Scientific Collections^] (GRSciColl), supported by videos and training activities. For institutions with collections that are not yet publishing data, updating their records in GRSciColl can be a simple first step towards engaging them as data publishers in the future. This work helps to raise the visibility of collections, including those that have not yet been digitized. (See https://docs.gbif.org/nodes-implementation-2023/en/#5-strengthen-support-services-for-collection-communities[Nodes Strategy #5^] for more detail.)
