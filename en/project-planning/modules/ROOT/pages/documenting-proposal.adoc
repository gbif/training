= Module 3: Documenting a full proposal

== Learning objectives

[NOTE.objectives]
====
This module includes review of the dataset deliverables assignment, provides a demonstration of working in the GBIF Grants Portal on a BID Full Proposal and includes two panel discussions with invited guests -- volunteers from the GBIF community of practice.

After completing this module, you should be able to perform the following:

* Understand the elements in a dataset deliverable
* Develop a dataset deliverable
* Navigate the GBIF Grants Portal
* Understand the work that goes into a biodiversity mobilization project
* Take a reviewer perspective to strengthen your full proposal
====

== Beyond the Upload: Understanding The Real Work of Biodiversity Data Mobilization

[NOTE.speak]
During this panel discussion invited volunteers from the GBIF Community of Practice will share their views on the work that goes into a mobilization project, quality vs quantity, the people behind the data, and how to insure that mobilized data remains relevant over time.

== Example of a dataset deliverable

This example is largely based on a real dataset (DOI: https://doi.org/10.15468/viradl[10.15468/viradl^]), but includes fictional elements to illustrate key concepts

*Dataset Title* 

Solomon Islands Community Seagrass & Dugong Conservation Data (2018-2024)
 
*Dataset Type*

Sampling-events, survey, monitoring

*Approximate # of Records*

1500

*Current Format of the data (i.e., undigitized, partially digitized, digitized)*

Partially digitized (Data up to 2022 have been digitized, however, data collected in 2023 and 2024 are still in paper form in field notebooks).

*Geographic Scope*

Tetepare island (Western Province), Kmaga (Isable Province) and Marau (Guadalcanal Province)

*Temporal Scope*

15 January 2018 to 31 January 2024

*Taxonomic Scope*

Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serulata, Enhalus acoroides, Halodule uninervis, Halophila Ovalis, Syringodium Isoetifolium, Thalassia hemprichii, Thalassoden Ciliatum, Zostera Capricorni

*Sampling Methodology (if relevant)*

Annual survey using 50 m fixed transect and standardized checklists to record seagrass and dugong occurrences and associated observations.

*Relevance [why this dataset?]*

The publication of this dataset will highlight the impact of community-based conservation efforts. It will also support Target 8 of the GBF by contributing to efforts to minimize the impact of climate change on biodiversity and build resilience, and promote the role of Locally Managed Marine Areas, a national priority identified in the Solomon Islandsâ€™ National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP). By publishing this dataset as a sampling event, it will enable the sharing of information on the relative abundance of species over time.

*Data Holders*

Solomon Islands Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change

*Has the data holder confirmed agreement to publish the data through GBIF?*

Yes

*Expected Publication date*

25 June 2026

== Tips for navigating the GBIF Grants Portal

== Lessons from BID Reviewers: Taking a Reviewer Perspective to Strengthen your Full Proposal

[NOTE.speak]
During this panel discussion invited reviewers from the GBIF Community of Practice will share their views on key signs that a proposal will be relevant and impactful, what influences their decisions and feedback, considerations on efficient use of resources and cost-effectiveness of a project, and sustainability of a project.
